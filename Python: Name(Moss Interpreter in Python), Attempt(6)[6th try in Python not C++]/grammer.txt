some basic rules:
data types: num, dec, bool, string, char
currently almost every keywords are accepted that are available in modern languages
implementations of detecting string and characters will be left to the parser

Parser is divided into different parts capable of doing specific tasks:
ExprParser: Parses expression such as the mathematical expressions, etc
            Able to parse complex mathematical expressions, strings, chars etc

Variables have the following properties: name, value, type, scope

May 3: 3:29PM: Successfully wired up the parser, executer and ExprParser. The interpreter is doing everything as intended
