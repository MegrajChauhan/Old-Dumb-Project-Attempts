These are all of my attempts in creating a compiler. It is pretty dump considering I have about 32 more folders of 32 more attempts and I am lazy to copy and move
them here from the drive. I tried all sorts of ways back then when I was trying to make a compiler but i failed miserably so many times. And I did all of these projects
when I had just 2 weeks of experience in C++, my first ever programming language. I feel pretty dumb to upload these on github but I think it serves as a good example
to me to look at them to know that I have come a long way. 

The folders have been renamed to know which attempt that was in which language. Didn't try in Javascript because I was exhausted from repeatedely restarting.

These projects are a failure but they have taught me a lot and I am proud to have started them.
